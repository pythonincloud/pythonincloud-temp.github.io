# Learn Python in 30 minutes

### Setting up tools

> Text here {: .prompt-info }

To get started we need to install following software:
- Python itself - allows us to run python programms
- VS Code - allows us to easily write code

Go to python website https://www.python.org/downloads/ or google "python download" and then click the download button. 
Once downloaded follow the normal installation steps. When installing make sure to check the add to PATH checkbox.

Now do the same process for vs code You need to go to website or Google VF code and then follow the normal installation process.

Now let's setup be VS code the left-hand side clip to Explorer right-click to the empty space 
  
### Writing first hello world application

Let's now write our first hello world application. In python it's very simple, for that we use the "print" command. 

```python
print('hello world') 
```
```java

```
### About the commands

A couple of words about the commands:
- In python the commands are called **functions**.
- To execute a function (or a command) you place a pair of **parenthesis** () at the end of the function name.
- Functions may or may not take input values, if they do you put them inside the parenthesis like this.  



- in the example above the we put a text data inside the parenthesis of the print function.  

So and put text data inside this 



### Creating a variable in python. 

The name should be as descriptive as possible.
message = 'hello world'
By convention  variables start with lowercase, if we have multiple words we separate them by underscore my_message
The variable holds the text data which in python called string and we can use this variable instead of the string we defined above.
print(message)
