Writing first hello world application

print('hello world') 

Creating a variable in python. The name should be as descriptive as possible.
message = 'hello world'
By convention  variables start with lowercase, if we have multiple words we separate them by underscore my_message
The variable holds the text data which in python called string and we can use this variable instead of the string we defined above.
print(message)
